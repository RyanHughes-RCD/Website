                    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                    <p>I'm the owner of Red Crane Dice. I create unique, high-quality dice sets for tabletop gaming enthusiasts. Ultimately, what I want is to help get quality products into the hands of those who care, and find a loving home for all my dice sets. </p>

                        <h3>How I Started</h3>
                        <p>I got my start in dicemaking during my final year of University, when I wanted to create a custom set of Dungeons and Dragons dice for my partner as an anniversary gift. Each die contains something special from our relationship together, and it's probably still my proudest set. I'm so lucky to have someone in my life who inspires me to create the way she does.</p>

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>My background is in Mechanical Engineering, and as a recent grad, I found myself diving deeper into dicemaking as a hobby, setting up my own social media and stores. Everything you see here, including this website, is entirely created by me. I have a passion for multimedia arts, robotics, classical mechanics, education, and robotics. You can find my portfolio site here.</p>
